## Course
This course has two parts, slides and exercises. The slides describe the exercises in detail. Each exercise has a starting branch and solution branch. Example `lesson-1` and `lesson-1-solution`.
## Exercises
### Hello world GraphQL server with Apollo Server
* branch - `lesson-1`

In this lesson you'll be creating a simple GraphQL server using Apollo Server. 
- [ ] install dependencies with yarn (prefered for version locking) or npm
- [ ] create a schema with at least one Type
- [ ] create a query from that Type
- [ ] create a mutation for that Type
- [ ] create mock resolvers for query and mutation
- [ ] start the server
- [ ] using GraphQL playground, perform query and mutation

### Creating Schema with SDL
* branch - `lesson-2`
* test command - `yarn test-schema` or `npm run test-schema`

This exercise will have you creating a GraphQL Schema based on the the mongoose models already created.
- [ ] create Type for product
- [ ] create inputs for product
- [ ] create queries for product
- [ ] create mutations for product
- [ ] ensure all tests pass by running test command

### Resolving Queries and Mutations
* branch - `lesson-3`
* test command - `yarn test-resolvers` or `npm run test-resolvers`

In this exercise, you'll be creating resolvers for the Queries and Mutations on the product type. You'll be using Mongoose models to perform CRUD in your resolvers.

- [ ] create resolvers for product queries
- [ ] create resolvers for product mutations
- [ ] create resolvers for prouduct createdBy field
- [ ] ensure all tests pass by running test command

### Interfaces and Unions
* branch - `lesson-4`
* test command - `yarn test-interfaces` or `npm run test-interfaces`

Now that you know about schemas and resolvers, we need to make some changes. Our product model in mongoose is split between 3 different product types. We need to make the product type an interface and then create types for each possible type in our mongoose model. Don't forget to create a resolver to resolve the type.

- [ ] change product type to an interface
- [ ] create Bike type that implements product
- [ ] create GamingPc type that implements product
- [ ] create Drone type that implements product
- [ ] create resolver for product interface that resolves the type
- [ ] ensure all tests pass by running test command

### Authentication
* branch - `lesson-5`
* test command - `yarn test-auth` or `npm run test-auth`

There are many many ways to authenticate with GraphQL. Our API is a public API, so we'll use API keys. Some queries need authentication, and some queries also need the correct role. Authenticate the request and update the product resolvers!

- [ ] authenticate the request and add use to context
- [ ] block all product queries and mutations if no user
- [ ] block all product mutations if not an admin role
- [ ] ensure all tests pass by running test command

### Testing
The other types don't have any test, go ahead and write some!
